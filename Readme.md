#TP3
Phi-Box

This is a WPF Application project. We use WPF for being able to create nice interface in the easiest way that we are allowed (Web is not).
To create a WPF Application you must go under "C#" in your New Project window. If you don't see it, it means that the package is not installed.

-> To add the package:

    go to your Visual Studio Installer
    
    click on "Modify" for the version you're working on preferably 2017, but 2015 might work too
    
    Check the ".NET desktop development"
    
    Press "Modify" in the bottom right corner

To assure that there will be no shit in the project PLEASE create a branch, work on it and then do a PULL REQUEST.

That way we are sure not to break the master, and that everyone will know which changes you have made. Furthermore, please do not play on others people branches if they did not authorised you (-> Simon <3 )

I hope your full colaboration on that! Nothing forbid you to do multiple branches if you are working on different things at the time.
