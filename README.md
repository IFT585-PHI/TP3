Phi-Box

This is a WPF Application project. We use WPF for being able to create nice interface in the easiest way that we are allowed (Web is not).
To create a WPF Application you must go under "C#" in your New Project window. If you don't see it, it means that the package is not installed.

-> To add the package:

    go to your Visual Studio Installer
    
    click on "Modify" for the version you're working on preferably 2017, but 2015 might work too
    
    Check the ".NET desktop development"
    
    Press "Modify" in the bottom right corner
